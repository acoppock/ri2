Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Alexander", "Coppock", email = "acoppock@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Randomization inference procedures for simple and complex randomized designs, including multi-armed trials, as described in Gerber and Green (2012, ISBN: 978-0393979954). Users formally describe their randomization procedure and test statistic. The randomization distribution of the test statistic under some null hypothesis is efficiently simulated.
